# pacseek
## A terminal user interface for searching and installing Arch Linux packages

pacseek is terminal user interface which allows you to browse and search through the Arch Linux package databases as well as the Arch User Repository. Packages can be installed/uninstalled with the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key.

![pacseek](https://github.com/moson-mo/pacseek/blob/main/assets/pacseek_animation.gif?raw=true?inline=true)

Package installation / removal is done with an AUR helper.   
In the default configuration, [yay](https://github.com/Jguer/yay) is being used.  
You can change this in the settings -> `Install command` / `AUR Install command`

There are some [examples for configuring other helpers](https://github.com/moson-mo/pacseek/wiki/Configuration#examples-for-other-aur-helpers) or even makepkg.
